Super Carrot, Brawl-styled and Modern-styled

Model and all textures made from scratch by Peardian using Cinema 4D and Fireworks.


Info:
I made this after studying the truly inspirational 3D artwork in Brawl and the art style of Super Mario 3D World.
The design of the model is stylized to match the look of the various power-ups in the most recent Mario games.
The leaves are meant to resemble both feathers and floppy bunny ears, hinting at the power it grants.
As a note, the new name "Super Carrot" is part of the redesign. The original name of the item is simply "Carrot".

I have never done any Brawl hacking, nor do I know how. Please don't ask me to help you.
